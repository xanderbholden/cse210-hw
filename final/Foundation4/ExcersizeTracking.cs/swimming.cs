Scenario
You have been hired by an event planning company. They help organize and market events throughout the world. They need you to write a program to track each of these events and produce the marketing material to distribute on social media. They typically handle a few main types of events:

Lectures, which have a speaker and have a limited capacity.
Receptions, which require people to RSVP, or register, beforehand.
Outdoor gatherings, which do not have a limit on attendees, but need to track the weather forecast.
Regardless of the type, all events need to have an Event Title, Description, Date, Time, and Address.

They would like the ability to generate three different messages:

Standard details - Lists the title, description, date, time, and address.
Full details - Lists all of the above, plus type of event and information specific to that event type. For lectures, this includes the speaker name and capacity. For receptions this includes an email for RSVP. For outdoor gatherings, this includes a statement of the weather.
Short description - Lists the type of event, title, and the date.
Program Specification
Write a program that has a base Event class along with derived classes for each type of event. These classes should contain the necessary data and provide methods to return strings for each of the messages the company desires.

Remember that any data or methods that are common among all types of events should be in the base class.

Once you have the classes in place, write a program that creates at least one event of each type and sets all of their values. Then, for event event, call each of the methods to generate the marketing messages and output their results to the screen.

In addition, your program must:

Use inheritance to avoid duplicating shared attributes and methods.
Use an address class for the addresses.
Follow the principles of encapsulation, making sure each member variable is private.

Certainly! Here is a simple example of a Python program that fulfills the specified requirements:

python
Copy code
import requests  # For fetching weather data from an API

class Address:
    def __init__(self, street, city, state, zip_code):
        self.street = street
        self.city = city

    def get_full_details(self):

        super().__init__(title, description, date, time, address)
        self.rsvp_email = rsvp_email

    def get_full_details(self):
        return f"{super().get_full_details()}\nType: Reception\nRSVP Email: {self.rsvp_email}"

class OutdoorGathering(Event):
    def __init__(self, title, description, date, time, address):
        super().__init__(title, description, date, time, address)

    def get_full_details(self):
        # Fetching weather data from an API (replace 'API_KEY' with a valid key)
        api_key = 'API_KEY'
        weather_data = requests.get(f'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={self.address.city},{self.address.state}&appid={api_key}').json()
        weather_description = weather_data['weather'][0]['description']

        return f"{super().get_full_details()}\nType: Outdoor Gathering\nWeather Forecast: {weather_description}"

# Example usage
address1 = Address("123 Main St", "Cityville", "Stateville", "12345")
lecture_event = Lecture("Lecture Title", "Interesting Lecture", "2024-03-01", "18:00", address1, "John Doe", 50)

address2 = Address("456 Park Ave", "Townsville", "Stateville", "67890")
reception_event = Reception("Reception Title", "Social Gathering", "2024-03-05", "19:30", address2, "rsvp@example.com")

address3 = Address("789 Nature Ln", "Villageland", "Stateville", "54321")
outdoor_event = OutdoorGathering("Outdoor Event", "Enjoy Nature", "2024-03-10", "15:00", address3)

events = [lecture_event, reception_event, outdoor_event]

for event in events:
    print("Standard Details:")
    print(event.get_standard_details())
    print("\nFull Details:")
    print(event.get_full_details())
    print("\nShort Description:")
    print(event.get_short_description())
    print("\n" + "="*50 + "\n")
Note: This is a simplified example, and in a real-world scenario, you might need to handle exceptions, validate inputs, and improve error handling. Additionally, you should replace the weather API key with a valid one if you choose to use the weather forecast feature.

Scenario
The local fitness center has hired you to write an app for their customers to track their exercise. They have facilities for the following:

Running
Stationary Bicycles
Swimming in the lap pool
For each activity, they want to track the the date and the length of the activity in minutes. Then, for each activity, they would like to also track the following:

Running: distance
Cycling: speed
Swimming: number of laps
For each activity, they do not want to store this information, but they would like to be able to get following information (by calculation if it is not stored directly):

The distance
The speed (miles per hour or kilometers per hour)
The pace (minutes per mile or minutes per kilometer)
A summary in the form of:
03 Nov 2022 Running (30 min)- Distance 3.0 miles, Speed 6.0 mph, Pace: 10.0 min per mile
03 Nov 2022 Running (30 min): Distance 4.8 km, Speed: 9.7 kph, Pace: 6.25 min per km
You may choose if your program uses miles or kilometers (you do not need to handle both). In either case the length of a lap in the lap pool is 50 meters.

Program Specification
Write a program that has a base Activity class and then has a derived class for each of the three activities. The base class should contain any attributes that are shared among all activities. Then, each derived class can define any additional attributes.

In addition, the base class should contain virtual methods for getting the distance, speed, pace. These methods should be overridden in the derived classes.

Finally, you should provide a GetSummary method to produce a string with all the summary information.
Remember that the summary method can make use of the other methods to produce its result. This method should be available for all classes, so it should be defined in the base class (you can override it in the derived classes if needed, but it may not need to be...).

Once you have the classes in place, write a program that creates at least one activity of each type. Put each of these activities in the same list. Then iterate through this list and call the GetSummary method on each item and display the results.

In addition, your program must:

Use inheritance to avoid duplicating shared attributes and methods.
Use method overriding for the calculation methods.
Follow the principles of encapsulation, making sure each member variable is private.
Math Hints:
Distance (km) = swimming laps * 50 / 1000
Distance (miles) = swimming laps * 50 / 1000 * 0.62
Speed (mph or kph) = (distance / minutes) * 60
Pace (min per mile or min per km)= minutes / distance
Speed = 60 / pace
Pace = 60 / speed

            new StationaryBicycle(new DateTime(2022, 11, 4), 20, 15.5),
            new Swimming(new DateTime(2022, 11, 5), 45, 10),

        {
            Console.WriteLine(activity.GetSummary());
        }
    }
}
This C# program defines a base Activity class with common attributes and methods. Three derived classes (Running, StationaryBicycle, and Swimming) inherit from the base class and provide specific implementations for distance, speed, and pace calculations. The GetSummary method in each class is overridden to provide a formatted summary for each activity. Finally, the Main method creates instances of each activity type, stores them in a list, and prints out their summaries.
